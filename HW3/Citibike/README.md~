## CitiBike HW - v1

Script "Complete_02.ipynb" can be run through as is, or optionally the month can be changed by inputting a different two character string value representing the month (eg '01' for January, '04' for April)

### Question
Are CitiBike's easing commuter journey's across the East River?

### Hypothesis
+ H0: The share of CitiBike subscribers crossing the East River during peak commuting hours (as defined by the MTA) is not significantly different at 95% confidence level than the share of CitiBike subscribers not crossing the river during peak hours.
+ H1: Not H0.

### Project work balance
#### hypothesis generation
Max, Arno, Clayton discussed and equally shared hypothesis generation.
Max had the original idea of looking at bridges as he is an avid CitiBike user

#### Tasks
1. Clayton is tagging trips as cross east river or not
2. Max is defining historic hours as "on peak" or "not on peak"
3. Arno completes a chi-square test of our hypothesis

#### Results
For the months tested (January, April, and August) we reject the null hypothesis that the share of bike journeys crossing the river during peak commuting hours is not significantly different than the share crossing the bridge during non-peak hours
