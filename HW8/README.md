## Citibike Trips Between New York Neighborhoods

**Concept of the visualization**
The visualization represents start and end neighborhood for citibike trips, limited to "outgoing" trips, which end in a different neighborhood than where theystarted. Data is from Citibike, for January 2015. Hover over a link to get moreinfo.

**Technical explanation of the visualization**
For a given link between two neighborhoods A and B, the width of the link is proportional to the share of trips starting in A and ending in B, among all Citibike trips going out of neighborhood A.
For instance, the first link on the top represents, among the outgoing trips starting in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the share of which ended in Brooklyn Heights/FortGreene (63.02 %).
